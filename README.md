## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS - NPM installed] (#)
- [Postman]

We are going to use [MongoLab] (https://mlab.com) to host our database, so we don't need to have [MongoDB] installed on our machine.

## Getting started

- Open the terminal and create a new folder for the project ```mkdir talk_proposal```
- Navigate to the root of the folder ```cd talk_proposal```
- Create the package.json file ```npm init```
- Create a file called server.js ```touch server.js```
- Create a folder called api ```mkdir api```
- Inside api folder, we are going to create folders [models, controllers and routes] ```mkdir api/controllers api/models api/routes```
- Create talksController.js and speakersController.js in the api/controller folder ```touch api/controllers/talksController.js api/controllers/speakerController.js```
- Create routes.js in the routes folder ```touch api/routes/routes.js```
- Create talkModel.js and speakerModel.js in the model folder ```touch api/models/todoListModel.js```
